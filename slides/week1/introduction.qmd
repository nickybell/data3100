## Generative AI Policy

✅ **What is permissible:**

-   Using GAI tools to answer questions, similar to using a search engine.
-   Providing your R code as context and ask for assistance in resolving specific errors, as long as you do not allow the GAI tools (agents) to directly edit the code itself.
-   Using GAI tools to generate code that is not specific to a data set.

❌ **What is not permissible:**

-   Generate code that is specific to a data set.
-   Allowing agents to directly edit code that you have written.
-   Using GAI tools to produce expository text (e.g., description, analysis, etc.)

## Ed Discussion

-   Please be sure to provide enough code that the TAs can reproduce your work, e.g.
